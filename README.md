# Smartwatch Showcase Page

## üìù Description

This is a simple, single-page static website created using HTML and internal CSS. The page serves as an informational showcase for smartwatches, providing general details about them, a list of popular models, and a detailed comparison table for three specific smartwatches from the "Noise" brand.
This project was created to demonstrate fundamental HTML and CSS skills.

 Features

-   **Image Display**: Includes an embedded image with appropriate `alt` text for accessibility.
-   **Data Table**: Features a well-structured table (`<table>`) to compare the specifications of different smartwatch models.
-   **External Link**: Contains a hyperlink (`<a>`) that opens in a new tab for further reading.
